R Markdown
----------

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**Cooking Recipe**
------------------

### **Quick, essential stovetop mac-and-cheese**

#### *Ingredients*

-   Kosher salt
-   4 ounces (115 grams) dried pasta, such as macaroni or another small twisty shape
-   2 teaspoons (10 grams) salted or unsalted butter
-   2 teaspoons (6 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1/2 cup (125 ml) low-fat or whole milk
-   Many grinds of black pepper
-   1/2 cup (1 ounce or 30 grams) finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese

#### *Special kitchen tools needed*

-   small-to-medium pot
-   spoon or whisk

#### *Steps*

1.  Boil well-salted water and add dried pasta
2.  Cook until firm tender, and drain
3.  Melt butter in the same stove
4.  Add flour and mix until it disappears, using a spoon or whisk
5.  Add milk, a little bit at a time, stirring continuously
6.  Season with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and many grinds of black pepper
7.  Bring sauce to a simmer
8.  Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring
9.  Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese until combined
10. Add drained pasta, stir to evenly coat
11. Scoop into a bowl!

**Euclidean Distance**
----------------------

#### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$.
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($\\sf{p\_{1}}$, $\\sf{p\_{2}}$,..., $\\sf{p\_{n}}$) and **q** = ($\\sf{q\_{1}}$, $\\sf{q\_{2}}$,..., $\\sf{q\_{n}}$) are two points in Euclidean *n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
*d*(**p, q**) = *d*(**q, p**)= $\\sqrt{(q\_{1} - p\_{1})^2 + (q\_{2} - p\_{2})^2+ ... + (q\_{n}-p\_{n})^2}$ =

$\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector: <br> $\\|\\textbf p\\|= \\sqrt{p\_{1}^2 + p\_{2}^2+ ... + p\_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p.p}}$, <br> where the last expression involves the dot product.
