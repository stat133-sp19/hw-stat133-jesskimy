## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##**Cooking Recipe**
###**Quick, essential stovetop mac-and-cheese**  
####_Ingredients_  
* Kosher salt  
* 4 ounces (115 grams) dried pasta, such as macaroni or another small twisty shape  
* 2 teaspoons (10 grams) salted or unsalted butter  
* 2 teaspoons (6 grams) all-purpose flour  
* 1/2 cup (125 ml) low-fat or whole milk  
* Many grinds of black pepper  
* 1/2 cup (1 ounce or 30 grams) finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese  

####_Special kitchen tools needed_  
* small-to-medium pot  
* spoon or whisk  

####_Steps_  
1. Boil well-salted water and add dried pasta  
2. Cook until firm tender, and drain  
3. Melt butter in the same stove  
4. Add flour and mix until it disappears, using a spoon or whisk  
5. Add milk, a little bit at a time, stirring continuously  
6. Season with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and many grinds of black pepper  
7. Bring sauce to a simmer  
8. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring  
9. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese until combined  
10. Add drained pasta, stir to evenly coat  
11. Scoop into a bowl!

##**Euclidean Distance**  
####Definition
***
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\overline{\textbf{pq}}$.  
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($\sf{p_{1}}$, $\sf{p_{2}}$,..., $\sf{p_{n}}$) and **q** = ($\sf{q_{1}}$, $\sf{q_{2}}$,..., $\sf{q_{n}}$) are two points in Euclidean _n-space_, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:  
$\mathit{d}$$(\textbf{p, q})$ = $\mathit{d}$$(\textbf{q, p})$=
$\sqrt{(q_{1} - p_{1})^2 + (q_{2} - p_{2})^2+ ... + (q_{n}-p_{n})^2}$ =

$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n  (q_i - p_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector: <br>
$\|\textbf p\|= \sqrt{p_{1}^2 + p_{2}^2+ ... + p_{n}^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p.p}}$, <br>
where the last expression involves the dot product.
