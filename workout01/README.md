This Workout 01 assignment is called "GSW Shot Charts." It involves visualizing shot data of NBA players and producing shot charts for some of the GSW players. We will work with other summaries and visualizations, producing a report document at the end. We will write code chunks as well as a narrative report to support the code.

There are 5 parts to the homework.
1. File Structure
2. Data
3. Data Preparation
4. Shot Charts
5. Report
